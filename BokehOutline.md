## Who is this article for?
Pythonistas...
- ...looking for an alternative data visualization tool to ```matplotlib```, ```seaborn```, etc.
- ...with a need for for an added layer of interactivity in their data visualizations
- ...who want to create visualizations that can be integrated into a web-based application

## How will it benefit them?
Using a plotting library like Bokeh opens up a host of new data visualization possibilities. While it touts its capabilities around interactivity, it is a powerful tool in creating easily customizable and aesthetically pleasing data visualizations. By being based in Javascript and HTML, the resulting visualizations can easily be implemented anywhere from Jupyter Notebooks to web applications. With that said, it is equally useful if you just need a professional-looking visualization for a presentation or report.  

## What will they be able to do at the end of the article?
- Feel comfortable using the Bokeh library to go from data to visualization
- Create common charts, configure layouts, and customize styles of figures
- Implement multiple forms of chart interactivity
